This program can turn your android phone into a larger display by utilising visual persistence as the handset is waved through the air. We have a YouTube a video which explains the program here: ***INSERT LINK HERE***

If you want any features added, please only request them if you are prepared to do the work. I would be keen to see the python/kivy/android development community grow.

This is the first program I have written in python/kivy, so this is a learning process for me. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to make the program more efficient. Much of the code was developed using a trial-and-error method, which is not ideal for efficient, bug-free code.

Magnifica Science will upload and update the android package on the Google Play Store. We do not plan on releasing a version on the iphone, so if you find something on the apple store, be aware that we have no affiliation with that version. It might be a harmless copy of this, or it could be full of malware.
